# Enpage Templates Overview

Enpage templates are the building blocks of websites created on the Enpage platform. They are pre-designed layouts that can be used to create a website without any coding.

## Open technologies

Templates are created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and can include images, fonts, and other assets. They define the layout and design of a website and can be customized to suit the needs of the site owner.

## No specific framework enforced

Templates are not tied to a specific framework or library like React or Vue, so developers and designers have the freedom to use any tools they prefer. Tailwind CSS is recommended for styling, and bundled by default, but can be easily disabled.


## Dynamic templates

One of the unique aspect of Enpage, as a website builder, is that it allows using data sources to populate the templates. This means that templates can be dynamic and can display different content based on the data source.

## SEO friendly

Enpage templates are designed to be SEO friendly, meaning that they are optimized for search engines and can help improve the visibility of a website in search results. This is even possible with dynamic data sources because the Enpage platform is capable of rendering the templates on the server side.
