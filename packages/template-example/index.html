<!--
This is an example of a Enpage template.

Enpage handles a few specific attributes that are used to control the appearance and behavior of the page.

You can also use pre-built web components from the @enpage/template-utils package.

Important:

- A template MUST a least have one <section>.
- Multiple <section> elements allow to simulate a multi-pages website.
- When using multiple <section> elements, the first one is considered the home page.

<!-- Script must be load as module. ES modules are deferrered by default, so they can access the DOM without problem -->
<script type="module">
  // `isEditorMode === true` when the page is being edited in the Enpage editor
  import { enpage, isEditorMode } from '@enpage/sdk';

</script>


<section>
  <div class="w-full bg-red-700" --data-container onclick="enpage.submitForm('#myform')">
    Hellooooo
  </div>
</section>
